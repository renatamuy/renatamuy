### Hello/Olá, I am Renata!

* 👩‍💻 I’m currently working on: disease ecology, biodiversity and fragmentation
* 🤯 I’m looking for help with: complexity
* 😄 Pronouns: her/she/dela/ela
* 💓 Love: mammals 🦇, maps 🌏, and teaching
* ⚡ Fact: after years of lazyness I was finally inspired enough to write this after all emojis and figs actually make every text better..
